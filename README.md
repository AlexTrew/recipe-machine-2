Utilities for running "recipe machine". 
"Recipe machine" is a raspberry pi 3 that sits in my kitchen and displays recipes. Its more convenient than juggling cookbooks
or messing about with your phone in the kitchen. 

This repo consists of:

- a file browser for running on touchscreen systems with low power and scarce resources
- a splash screen to be displayed when the machine falls asleep and boots up

Will be added in future:

- the configuration files and scripts needed to boot straight into the kiosk
- an auto setup script for anyone (if there ever is anyone) who wants to try running this themselves
